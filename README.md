# course-manager-18
Simple JavaFX desktop application to manage university courses and related data. The general idea came from the necessity of finding a more compact and organized way 
to store and manage the many course-related information as I progress in my study career, such as marks, projects, notes and files.
Using bare folders to store data turned out to be an inefficient way to organize my files, since often I had to work on different machines
or to retrieve files related to courses completed years ago, or stored in some backup or in some cloud.

Coming from Swing GUI development, I found this a good way to pratice and learn the new JavaFX features and development strategies.
FXML along with SceneBuilder was used to implement MVC pattern. 
The project just started and is current under development.
